-1, $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
-1, I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats

1,"  I DO like your airlines, congrats! : )"
1, Hi! I ❤️ your company and fly all the time. I was wondering if you could please share this link &amp; read! http://t.co/lO6LghPcdU
1,Always have it together!!! You're welcome! RT :  You're so welcome.
1, Thank you! Have a nice evening.
-1, I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren't sure what city my bag was in.
1,So appreciated! 
1, Whoa. Thanks and that's what I wanted to hear! Early flight coming up. Thanks for the reply.
-1, I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
-1, Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
-1, Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
1," Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!"
1,", will you fill it? Yes they will. Thanks! ,  http://t.co/daaa0rqBXW"
-1," I got an email saying ""changes to my MileagePlus account are confirmed"" but I didn't make any changes. Help?"
-1," should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag."
1," I love and appreciate the fact that you guys rarely Cancelled Flight flights and are on time, but I need a Cancelled Flightlation this time. "
1," Thanks, you guys are the best"
1, Thank you for your help today.  I have been a loyal US airways customer and i appreciate your responding to my tweets.
-1, I wasn't important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!!
-1, I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
-1, sucks.  Flt 2692 Late Flight by 20 mins missed my connection.  Thanks for the 10 bucks and a middle seat on the next flt.
-1, why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
-1, no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
1," ah no the staff was perfect this morning at JFK, more sleep for me!! :)"
-1, A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
1, awesome thank you very much for the help
-1, : her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040
-1," Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA!"
1, The chairs could use some TLC. And more power outlets in the area would be a bonus. Headed to  !
1, thank you
-1, had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh
1, you ROCK for making it so I can watch  on my flight!!   
1,Thank you “:  I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH”
-1, I have been calling for 3 days!
1, had me at their safety video . . . http://t.co/CqMm7nuE9m  LOVED my first cross country flight.  
-1, I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
-1," I was believing you for a minute, but we just got delayed for a 3rd time!"
-1," not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet..."
1, Offers Atlanta Unprecedented Perk http://t.co/nustgpElSf http://t.co/Be0B4K1Xbt
1,  Love it. They're cute
1, Best GAgent in a long time - Danny B. for US628 DFW-CLT. Appreciated how up to date he kept us during irrops. Super professional!
-1, the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
-1, thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
-1, Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the  merger. 
1,"  Done and done! Best airline around, hands down!"
-1, not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.
-1, WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
-1, Please can someone contact me regarding my missing bag? It has been 3 days. Online tracking shows nothing.
-1, I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
-1, ever think about hiring more agents? Come on now. Don't you think 4 hour holds is a little ridiculous? Get a clue
1, Great - thank you.
-1, Err 2 hour wait time for the Exec. Plat. line?
1," classiq, luv Virgin America. Greetingz"
-1," thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service "
1, thanks
-1, Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
-1," flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I'm entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued?"
1, thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
-1,"  If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn't work because..."
1,"  Thank you for a couple of easy, hassle free flights today, professional and friendly staff made everything easy!"
1, no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
1," done! Thank you for the quick response, apparently faster than sitting on hold ;)"
-1,  we'll have time and they aren't doing a damn thing. I'm the guy in the winter hat and frowny face
1, Thanks!

1,. you've got a mess here at DTW but your staff is doing great.
1,  please just tweet this❤️ I fly jetblue every time btw
1, - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
